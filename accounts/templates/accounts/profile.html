<h1>Logged in as: {{ request.user.username }}</h1>

<a href="{% url 'account_logout' %}">Logout</a>
 The profile.html template is very simple. It just displays the username of the logged-in user and provides a link to the logout view. 
 The logout view is provided by Djangoâ€™s authentication system. We can use the  logout()  function from  django.contrib.auth  to log out the user.
